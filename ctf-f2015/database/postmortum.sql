The plaintext of this talk has been made available to the\r\norganizers.  While I will not be taking questions today, you are\r\nwelcome to contact me later and I will do what I can to reply.  For\r\nsimple clarity, let me repeat the abstract for this talk:\r\n\r\n   Power exists to be used.  Some wish for cyber safety, which they\r\n   will not get.  Others wish for cyber order, which they will not\r\n   get.  Some have the eye to discern cyber policies that are \"the\r\n   least worst thing;\" may they fill the vacuum of wishful thinking.\r\n\r\nThere are three professions that beat their practitioners into a\r\nstate of humility: farming, weather forecasting, and cyber security.\r\nI practice two of those, and, as such, let me assure you that the\r\nrecommendations which follow are presented in all humility.  Humility\r\ndoes not mean timidity.  Rather, it means that when a strongly held\r\nbelief is proven wrong, that the humble person changes their mind.\r\nI expect that my proposals will result in considerable push-back,\r\nand changing my mind may well follow.  Though I will say it again\r\nlater, this speech is me talking for myself.\r\n\r\nAs if it needed saying, cyber security is now a riveting concern,\r\na top issue in many venues more important than this one.  This is\r\nnot to insult Black Hat; rather it is to note that every speaker,\r\nevery writer, every practitioner in the field of cyber security who\r\nhas wished that its topic, and us with it, were taken seriously has\r\ngotten their wish.  Cyber security *is* being taken seriously,\r\nwhich, as you well know is not the same as being taken usefully,\r\ncoherently, or lastingly.  Whether we are talking about laws like\r\nthe Digital Millenium Copyright Act or the Computer Fraud and Abuse\r\nAct, or the non-lawmaking but perhaps even more significant actions\r\nthat the Executive agencies are undertaking, \"we\" and the cyber\r\nsecurity issue have never been more at the forefront of policy.\r\nAnd you ain\'t seen nothing yet.\r\n\r\nI wish that I could tell you that it is still possible for one\r\nperson to hold the big picture firmly in their mind\'s eye, to track\r\neverything important that is going on in our field, to make few if\r\nany sins of omission.  It is not possible; that phase passed sometime\r\nin the last six years.  I have certainly tried to keep up but I\r\nwould be less than candid if I were not to say that I know that I\r\nam not keeping up, not even keeping up with what is going on in my\r\nown country much less all countries.  Not only has cybersecurity\r\nreached the highest levels of attention, it has spread into nearly\r\nevery corner.  If area is the product of height and width, then the\r\nfootprint of cybersecurity has surpassed the grasp of any one of us.\r\n\r\nThe rate of technological change is certainly a part of it.  When\r\nyounger people ask my advice on what they should do or study to\r\nmake a career in cyber security, I can only advise specialization.\r\nThose of us who were in the game early enough and who have managed\r\nto retain an over-arching generalist knowledge can\'t be replaced\r\nvery easily because while absorbing most new information most of\r\nthe time may have been possible when we began practice, no person\r\nstarting from scratch can do that now.  Serial specialization is\r\nnow all that can be done in any practical way.  Just looking at the\r\nBlack Hat program will confirm that being really good at any one\r\nof the many topics presented here all but requires shutting out the\r\ndemands of being good at any others.\r\n\r\nWhy does that matter?  Speaking for myself, I am not interested in\r\nthe advantages or disadvantages of some bit of technology unless I\r\ncan grasp how it is that that technology works.  Whenever I see\r\nmarketing material that tells me all the good things that adopting\r\nthis or that technology makes possible, I remember what George\r\nSantayana said, that \"Scepticism is the chastity of the intellect;\r\nit is shameful to give it up too soon, or to the first comer.\" I\r\nsuspect that a majority of you have similar skepticism -- \"It\'s\r\nmagic!\" is not the answer a security person will ever accept.  By\r\nand large, I can tell *what* something is good for once I know *how*\r\nit works.  Tell me how it works and then, but only then, tell me\r\nwhy you have chosen to use those particular mechanisms for the\r\nthings you have chosen to use them for.\r\n\r\nPart of my feeling stems from a long-held and well-substantiated\r\nbelief that all cyber security technology is dual use.  Perhaps\r\ndual use is a truism for any and all tools from the scalpel to the\r\nhammer to the gas can -- they can be used for good or ill -- but I\r\nknow that dual use is inherent in cyber security tools.  If your\r\ndefinition of \"tool\" is wide enough, I suggest that the cyber\r\nsecurity tool-set favors offense these days.  Chris Inglis, recently\r\nretired NSA Deputy Director, remarked that if we were to score cyber\r\nthe way we score soccer, the tally would be 462-456 twenty minutes\r\ninto the game,[CI] i.e., all offense.  I will take his comment as\r\nconfirming at the highest level not only the dual use nature of\r\ncybersecurity but also confirming that offense is where the innovations\r\nthat only States can afford is going on.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this essay is an outgrowth from, an extension of,\r\nthat increasing importance of cybersecurity.  With the humility of\r\nwhich I spoke, I do not claim that I have the last word.  What I\r\ndo claim is that when we speak about cybersecurity policy we are\r\nno longer engaging in some sort of parlor game.  I claim that policy\r\nmatters are now the most important matters, that once a topic area,\r\nlike cybersecurity, becomes interlaced with nearly every aspect of\r\nlife for nearly everybody, the outcome differential between good\r\npolicies and bad policies broadens, and the ease of finding answers\r\nfalls.  As H.L. Mencken so trenchantly put it, \"For every complex\r\nproblem there is a solution that is clear, simple, and wrong.\"\r\n\r\nThe four verities of government are these:\r\n. Most important ideas are unappealing\r\n. Most appealing ideas are unimportant\r\n. Not every problem has a good solution\r\n. Every solution has side effects\r\n\r\nThis quartet of verities certainly applies to the interplay between\r\ncybersecurity and the affairs of daily living.  Over my lifetime\r\nthe public expectation of what government can and should do has\r\nspectacularly broadened from guaranteeing that you may engage in\r\nthe \"pursuit of happiness\" to guaranteeing happiness in and of\r\nitself.  The central dynamic internal to government is, and always\r\nhas been, that the only way for either the Executive or the Legislature\r\nto control the many sub-units of government is by way of how much\r\nmoney they can hand out.  Guaranteeing happiness has the same dynamic\r\n-- that the only tool government really has to achieve the outcome\r\nof everyone happy or everyone healthy or everyone safe at all times\r\nfrom things that go bump in the night is through the dispensing of\r\nmoney.  This is true in foreign policy; one can reasonably argue\r\nthat the United States\' 2007 troop \"surge\" in Iraq did provide an\r\nimprovement in safety.  One can also argue that the work of those\r\ntroops, some of whom gave what Abraham Lincoln called \"the last\r\nfull measure of devotion,\" was materially aided by the less publicized\r\narrival of C-130s full of $100 bills with which to buy off potential\r\ncombatants.  Why should cybersecurity be any different?\r\n\r\nSuppose, however, that surveillance becomes too cheap to meter,\r\nthat is to say too cheap to limit through budgetary processes.  Does\r\nthat lessen the power of the Legislature more, or the power of the\r\nExecutive more?  I think that ever-cheaper surveillance substantially\r\nchanges the balance of power in favor of the Executive and away\r\nfrom the Legislature.  While President Obama was referring to\r\nsomething else when he said \"I\'ve Got A Pen And I\'ve Got A Phone,\"\r\nhe was speaking to exactly this idea -- things that need no\r\nappropriations are outside the system of checks and balances.  Is\r\nthe ever-wider deployment of sensors in the name of cybersecurity\r\nactually contributing to our safety?  Or is it destroying our safety\r\nin order to save it?\r\n\r\nTo be entirely clear by way of repetition, this essay is written by\r\nsomeone as his own opinion and not on behalf of anyone else.  It\r\nis written without the supposed benefits of insider information; I\r\nhold no Clearance but am instead informed solely by way of open\r\nsource intelligence.  This path may be poised to grow easier; if\r\nthe chief benefit of having a Clearance is to be able to see into\r\nthe future a little further than those without one, then it must\r\nfollow that as the pace of change accelerates the difference between\r\nhow far can you see with a Clearance versus how far can you see\r\nwithout one will shrink.\r\n\r\nThere are, in other words, parallels between cybersecurity and the\r\nintelligence functions insofar as predicting the future has a strong\r\nrole to play in preparing your defenses for probable attacks.  As\r\nDave Aitel has repeatedly pointed out, the hardest part of crafting\r\ngood attack tools is testing them before deployment.  Knowing what\r\nyour tool will find, and how to cope with that, is surely harder\r\nthan finding an exploitable flaw in and of itself.  This, too, may\r\ngrow in importance if the rigor of testing causes attackers to use\r\nsome portion of the Internet at large as their test platform rather\r\nthan whatever rig they can afford to set up in their own shop.  If\r\nthat is the case, then full scale traffic logs become an indispensable\r\nintelligence tool insofar as when an attack appears to be de novo\r\nthose with full scale traffic logs may be in a position to answer\r\nthe question \"How long has this been going on?\"  The company Net\r\nWitness, now part of EMC, is one player who comes to mind in this\r\nregard, and there are others.  This idea of looking backward for\r\nevidence that you didn\'t previously know enough to look for does\r\ncertainly have intelligence value both for the Nation State and for\r\nthe enterprise.\r\n\r\nAnd there is a lot of traffic that we don\'t have a handle on.  John\r\nQuarterman of Internet Perils makes a round number guess that 10%\r\nof Internet backbone traffic is unidentifiable as to protocol.[JQ]\r\nWhether he is off by a factor of two in either direction, that is\r\nstill a lot of traffic.  Arbor Networks estimates that perhaps 2%\r\nof all *identifiable* backbone traffic is, to use their term, \"raw\r\nsewage.\"[AN]  There are plenty of other estimates of this sort, of\r\ncourse.  To my way of thinking, all such estimates continue to\r\nremind us that the end-to-end design of the Internet[SRC] was not\r\nsome failure of design intellect but a brilliant avoidance of having\r\nto pick between the pitiful toy a completely safe Internet would\r\nhave to be versus an Internet that was the ultimate tool of State\r\ncontrol.  In nothing else is it more apt to say that our choices\r\nare Freedom, Security, Convenience -- Choose Two.\r\n\r\nLet me now turn to some policy proposals on a suite of pressing\r\ncurrent topics.  None of these proposals are fully formed, but as\r\nyou know, those who don\'t play the game don\'t make the rules.  These\r\nproposals are not in priority order, though some are more at odds\r\nwith current practice than others and might, therefore, be said to\r\nbe more pressing.  There are more where these came from, but this\r\ntalk has a time limit, and there is a meta-analysis at the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Mandatory reporting -- YES/Tiered\r\n\r\nThe United States Centers for Disease Control are respected the\r\nworld around.  When you really get down to it, three capabilities\r\ndescribe the CDC and why they are as effective as they are: (1)\r\nmandatory reporting of communicable diseases, (2) stored data and\r\nthe data analytic skill to distinguish a statistical anomaly from\r\nan outbreak, and (3) away teams to take charge of, say, the appearance\r\nof Ebola in Miami.  Everything else is details.  The most fundamental\r\nof these is the mandatory reporting of communicable diseases.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, we have well established rules about medical\r\nprivacy.  Those rules are helpful; when you check into the hospital\r\nthere is a licensure-enforced, accountability-based, need-to-know\r\nregime that governs the handling of your data.[PHI]   Most days,\r\nthat is, but if you check in with Bubonic Plague or Typhus or\r\nAnthrax, you will have zero privacy as those are the \"mandatory\r\nreporting of communicable disease conditions\" as variously mandated\r\nnot just by the CDC but by public health law in all fifty States.\r\n\r\nSo let me ask you, would it make sense, in a public health of the\r\nInternet way, to have a mandatory reporting regime for cybersecurity\r\nfailures?  Do you favor having to report cyber penetrations of your\r\nfirm or of your household to some branch of government or some\r\nnon-government entity?  Should you face criminal charges if you\r\nfail to make such a report?  Forty-eight States vigorously penalize\r\nfailure to report sexual molestation of children.[SMC]  The (US)\r\nComputer Fraud and Abuse Act[CFAA] defines a number of felonies\r\nrelated to computer penetrations, and the U.S. Code says that it\r\nis a crime to fail to report a felony of which you have knowledge.[USC]\r\nIs cybersecurity event data the kind of data around which you want\r\nto enforce mandatory reporting?  Forty-six States require mandatory\r\nreporting of one class of cyber failures in the form of their data\r\nbreach laws,[CSB] while the Verizon Data Breach Investigations\r\nReport[VDB] found, and the Index of Cyber Security[ICS] confirmed,\r\nthat 70-80% of data breaches are discovered by unrelated third\r\nparties, not by the victim, meaning that the victim might never\r\nknow if those who do the discovering were to keep quiet.  If you\r\ndiscover a cyber attack, do you have an ethical obligation to report\r\nit?  Should the law mandate that you fulfill such an obligation?\r\n\r\nMy answer to this set of questions is to mirror the CDC, that is\r\nfor the force of law to require reporting of cybersecurity failures\r\nthat are above some severity threshold that we have yet to negotiate.\r\nBelow that threshold, I endorse the suggestion made in a piece two\r\nweeks ago, \"Surviving on a Diet of Poisoned Fruit,\" by Richard\r\nDanzig where he made this policy proposal:[RD]\r\n\r\n   Fund a data collection consortium that will illuminate the\r\n   character and magnitude of cyber attacks against the U.S. private\r\n   sector, using the model of voluntary reporting of near-miss\r\n   incidents in aviation.  Use this enterprise as well to help\r\n   develop common terminology and metrics about cybersecurity.\r\n\r\n   While regulatory requirements for aviation accident reporting\r\n   are firmly established through the National Transportation Safety\r\n   Board, there are no requirements for reporting the vastly more\r\n   numerous and often no less informative near misses.  Efforts to\r\n   establish such requirements inevitably generate resistance:\r\n   Airlines would not welcome more regulation and fear the reputational\r\n   and perhaps legal consequences of data visibility; moreover,\r\n   near accidents are intrinsically more ambiguous than accidents.\r\n   An alternative path was forged in 2007 when MITRE, a government\r\n   contractor, established an Aviation Safety Information Analysis\r\n   and Sharing (ASIAS) system receiving near-miss data and providing\r\n   anonymized safety, benchmarking and proposed improvement reports\r\n   to a small number of initially participating airlines and the\r\n   Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).\r\n\r\nToday, 44 airlines participate in that program voluntarily.  The\r\ncombination of a mandatory CDC model for above-threshold cyber\r\nevents and a voluntary ASIAS model for below-threshold events is\r\nwhat I recommend.  This leaves a great deal of thinking still to\r\nbe done; diseases are treated by professionals, but malware infections\r\nare treated by amateurs.  Diseases spread within jurisdictions\r\nbefore they become global, but malware is global from the get-go.\r\nDiseases have predictable behaviors, but malware comes from sentient\r\nopponents.  Don\'t think this proposal is an easy one or one without\r\nside effects.\r\n\r\n2. Net neutrality -- CHOICE\r\n\r\nThere is considerable irony in the Federal Communications Commission\r\nclassifying the Internet as an information service and not as a\r\ncommunications service insofar as while that may have been a gambit\r\nto relieve ISPs of telephone-era regulation, the value of the\r\nInternet is ever more the bits it carries, not the carriage of those\r\nbits.  The FCC decisions are both several and now old, the FCC\r\nclassified cable as an information service in 2002, classified DSL\r\nas an information service in 2005, classified wireless broadband\r\nas an information service in 2007, and classified broadband over\r\npower lines as an information service in 2008.  A decision by the\r\nD.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on this very point appeared earlier\r\nthis year,[VZF] but settled little.  The question remains, is the\r\nInternet a telecommunications service or an information service?\r\n\r\nI\'ve nothing new to say to you about the facts, the near-facts, nor\r\nthe lying distortions inherent in the debate regarding network\r\nneutrality so far or still to come.  What I can say is that network\r\nneutrality is no panacea nor is it anathema; peoples\' tastes vary\r\nand so do corporations\'.  What I can say is that the varied tastes\r\nneed to be reflected in constrained choice rather than the idea\r\nthat the FTC or some other agency can assure happiness if and only\r\nif it, rather than corporations or individuals, does the choosing.\r\nChanneling for Doctor Seuss, if I ran the zoo I\'d call up the ISPs\r\nand say this:\r\n\r\n  Hello, Uncle Sam here.\r\n\r\n  You can charge whatever you like based on the contents of what\r\n  you are carrying, but you are responsible for that content if it\r\n  is hurtful; inspecting brings with it a responsibility for what\r\n  you learn.\r\n   -or-\r\n  You can enjoy common carrier protections at all times, but you\r\n  can neither inspect nor act on the contents of what you are\r\n  carrying and can only charge for carriage itself.  Bits are bits.\r\n\r\n  Choose wisely.  No refunds or exchanges at this window.\r\n\r\nIn other words, ISPs get the one or the other; they do not get both.\r\nThe FCC gets some heartache but also a natural experiment in whether\r\nthose who choose common carrier status turn out differently than\r\nthose who choose multi-tiered service grades with liability exposure.\r\nWe already have a lot of precedent and law in this space.  The\r\nUnited States Postal Service\'s term of art, \"sealed against inspection,\"\r\nis reserved for items on which the highest postage rates are charged;\r\nis that also worth stirring into the mix?\r\n\r\nAs a side comment, I might add that it was in Seuss\' book _If I Ran\r\nthe Zoo_ that the word \"nerd\" first appeared in English.  If Black\r\nHat doesn\'t yet have an official book, I\'d suggest this one.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Source code liability -- CHOICE\r\n\r\nNat Howard said that \"Security will always be exactly as bad as it\r\ncan possibly be while allowing everything to still function,\"[NH]\r\nbut with each passing day, that \"and still function\" clause requires\r\na higher standard.  As Ken Thompson told us in his Turing Award\r\nlecture, there is no technical escape;[KT] in strict mathematical\r\nterms you neither trust a program nor a house unless you created\r\nit 100% yourself, but in reality most of us will trust a house built\r\nby a suitably skilled professional, usually we will trust it more\r\nthan one we had built ourselves, and this even if we have never met\r\nthe builder, or even if he is long since dead.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this trust is that shoddy building work has had that\r\ncrucial \"or else ...\" clause for more than 3700 years:\r\n\r\n    If a builder builds a house for someone, and does not construct\r\n    it properly, and the house which he built falls in and kills\r\n    its owner, then the builder shall be put to death.\r\n	-- Code of Hammurabi, approx 1750 B.C.\r\n\r\nToday the relevant legal concept is \"product liability\" and the\r\nfundamental formula is \"If you make money selling something, then\r\nyou better do it well, or you will be held responsible for the\r\ntrouble it causes.\"  For better or poorer, the only two products\r\nnot covered by product liability today are religion and software,\r\nand software should not escape for much longer.  Poul-Henning Kamp\r\nand I have a strawman proposal for how software liability regulation\r\ncould be structured.\r\n\r\n.......................\r\n0. Consult criminal code to see if damage caused was due to intent\r\n   or willfulness.\r\n.......................\r\n\r\nWe are only trying to assign liability for unintentionally caused\r\ndamage, whether that\'s sloppy coding, insufficient testing, cost\r\ncutting, incomplete documentation, or just plain incompetence.\r\nClause zero moves any kind of intentionally inflicted damage out\r\nof scope.  That is for your criminal code to deal with, and most\r\nalready do.\r\n\r\n.......................\r\n1. If you deliver your software with complete and buildable source\r\n   code and a license that allows disabling any functionality or\r\n   code the licensee decides, your liability is limited to a refund.\r\n.......................\r\n\r\nClause one is how to avoid liability: Make it possible for your\r\nusers to inspect and chop out any and all bits of your software\r\nthey do not trust or want to run.  That includes a bill of materials\r\n(\"Library ABC comes from XYZ\") so that trust has some basis,\r\nparalleling why there are ingredient lists on processed foods.\r\n\r\nThe word \"disabling\" is chosen very carefully:  You do not need to\r\ngive permission to change or modify how the program works, only to\r\ndisable the parts of it that the licensee does not want or trust.\r\nLiability is limited even if the licensee never actually looks at\r\nthe source code; as long has he has received it, you (as maker) are\r\noff the hook.  All your other copyrights are still yours to control,\r\nand your license can contain any language and restriction you care\r\nfor, leaving the situation unchanged with respect to hardware-locking,\r\nconfidentiality, secrets, software piracy, magic numbers, etc.\r\n\r\nFree and Open Source Software (FOSS) is obviously covered by this\r\nclause which leaves its situation unchanged.\r\n\r\n.......................\r\n2. In any other case, you are liable for whatever damage your\r\n   software causes when it is used normally.\r\n.......................\r\n\r\nIf you do not want to accept the information sharing in Clause 1,\r\nyou fall under Clause 2, and must live with normal product liability,\r\njust like manufactures of cars, blenders, chain-saws and hot coffee.\r\n\r\nHow dire the consequences, and what constitutes \"used normally\" is\r\nfor your legislature and courts to decide, but let us put up a\r\nstrawman example:\r\n\r\n    A sales-person from one of your long time vendors visits and\r\n    delivers new product documentation on a USB key, you plug the\r\n    USB key into your computer and copy the files onto the computer.\r\n\r\nThis is \"used normally\" and it should never cause your computer to\r\nbecome part of a botnet, transmit your credit card number to Elbonia,\r\nor copy all your design documents to the vendor.  If it does, your\r\ncomputer\'s operating system is defective.\r\n\r\nThe majority of today\'s commercial software would fall under Clause\r\n2 and software houses need a reasonable chance to clean up their\r\nact or to move under Clause 1, so a sunrise period is required.\r\nBut no longer than five years -- we are trying to solve a dire\r\ncomputer security problem here.\r\n\r\nAnd that is it really:  Either software houses deliver quality and\r\nback it up with product liability, or they will have to let their\r\nusers protect themselves.  The current situation -- users can\'t see\r\nwhether they need to protect themselves and have no recourse to\r\nbeing unprotected -- cannot go on.  We prefer self-protection (and\r\nfast recovery), but other\'s mileage may differ.\r\n\r\nWould it work?  In the long run, absolutely yes.  In the short run,\r\nit is pretty certain that there will be some nasty surprises as\r\nbadly constructed source code gets a wider airing.  The FOSS community\r\nwill, in parallel, have to be clear about the level of care they\r\nhave taken, and their build environments as well as their source\r\ncode will have to be kept available indefinitely.\r\n\r\nThe software houses will yell bloody murder the minute legislation\r\nlike this is introduced, and any pundit and lobbyist they can afford\r\nwill spew their dire predictions that \"This law will mean the end\r\nof computing as we know it!\"\r\n\r\nTo which our considered answer will be:\r\n\r\n    Yes, please!  That was exactly the idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Strike back -- LIMITED YES\r\n\r\nI suspect that a fair number of you have, in fact, struck back at\r\nsome attacker somewhere or, at least, done targeting research even\r\nif you didn\'t pull the trigger.  I\'d trust many of you to identify\r\ntargets carefully enough to minimize collateral damage, but what\r\nwe are talking about here is the cyber equivalent of the smart bomb.\r\nAs I implied earlier, cyber smart bombs are what the national\r\nlaboratories of several countries are furiously working on.  In\r\nthat sense, you do know what is happening behind the curtain, and\r\nyou know how hard that targeting really is because you know how\r\nhard attribution -- real attribution -- really is.\r\n\r\nThe issue is shared infrastructure, and that issue is not going\r\naway.  There are some entities that can operate globally and strike\r\nback effectively, Microsoft and the FBI teaming up on the GameOver\r\nZeus trojan for example,[GOZ] but that\'s an expensive therapy in\r\nlimited supply that can only be applied to the most damaging malware.\r\nNevertheless, that is the therapy we have.  Smaller entities cannot\r\nact globally nor can they act in certain ways without pairing with\r\nnational agencies.  That can, and must, go on, but I don\'t see how\r\nthe individual or the smaller entity can shoot back.  All I see is\r\nfor the individual or the smaller entity to put all their effort\r\ninto having fast recovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Fall backs and resiliency -- TOO COMPLICATED FOR ONE POLICY\r\n\r\nThere has always been a lot of talk about what to do when failure\r\nis unacceptable and yet failure is inevitable.  Heretofore, almost\r\nanything that has come to be seen as essential to the public gets\r\nsome sort of performance standard imposed upon it, electricity and\r\nwater, say.  But let\'s talk about software.\r\n\r\nFor one example, a commonly voiced desire for cryptographic protocols\r\nis \"algorithm agility,\" the ability to swap from one cryptographic\r\nalgorithm to another if and when the first one becomes unsafe.  The\r\nsecurity benefit of such a swap is not what you turn on but what\r\nyou turn off.  For that to be possible, a second algorithm has to\r\nalready be in place, but that means that the second algorithm had\r\nto be designed in at the outset and at both ends, with a way to\r\nchoose between them such that either end of the proposed connection\r\ncan force a change-over to the alternate algorithm.  One might argue\r\nthat implementing algorithm agility actually means a single, more\r\ncomplex algorithm.  Or maybe what you want is two algorithms where\r\nyou always use both, such as when you encrypt with one algorithm\r\nand super-encrypt with another so that the failure of one has no\r\npractical effect on security and nothing has to change.\r\n\r\nI say all that just to demonstrate that it is not always simple to\r\nhave a pre-deployed fallback should something break, that design\r\nwillpower alone is not enough.  So perhaps mandating pre-deployed\r\nfallbacks is a bad idea entirely.  Perhaps what is needed is a way\r\nto reach out and upgrade the endpoints when the time of necessity\r\ncomes.  But today, or real soon now, most of the places needing a\r\nremote management interface through which you can remotely upgrade\r\nthe endpoints are embedded hardware.  So let me ask a question,\r\nshould or should not an embedded system be required to have a remote\r\nmanagement interface?  If it does not, then a late discovered flaw\r\ncannot be fixed without visiting all the embedded systems -- which\r\nis likely to be infeasible because some you will be unable to find,\r\nsome will be where you cannot again go, and there will be too many\r\nof them in any case.  If it does have a remote management interface,\r\nthe opponent of skill will focus on that and, once a break is\r\nachieved, will use those self-same management functions to ensure\r\nthat not only does he retain control over the long interval but,\r\nas well, you will be unlikely to know that he is there.\r\n\r\nPerhaps what is needed is for embedded systems to be more like\r\nhumans, and I most assuredly do not mean artificially intelligent.\r\nBy \"more like humans\" I mean this: Embedded systems, if having no\r\nremote management interface and thus out of reach, are a life form\r\nand as the purpose of life is to end, an embedded system without a\r\nremote management interface must be so designed as to be certain\r\nto die no later than some fixed time.  Conversely, an embedded\r\nsystem with a remote management interface must be sufficiently\r\nself-protecting that it is capable of refusing a command.  Inevitable\r\ndeath and purposive resistance are two aspects of the human condition\r\nwe need to replicate, not somehow imagine that to overcome them is\r\nto improve the future.\r\n\r\nLest some of you think this is all so much picayune, tendentious,\r\nacademic perfectionist posturing, let me inform some of you and\r\nremind the others that it is entirely possible to deny the Internet\r\nto a large fraction of its users.  Home routers have drivers and\r\noperating systems that are binary blobs amounting to snapshots of\r\nthe state of Linux plus the lowest end commodity chips that were\r\nextant at the time of the router\'s design.  Linux has moved on.\r\nDevice drivers have moved on.  Samba has moved on.  Chipsets have\r\nmoved on.  But what is sold at Best Buy or the like is remarkably\r\ncheap and remarkably old.  With certainty born of long engineering\r\nexperience, I assert that those manufacturers can no longer build\r\ntheir deployed software blobs from source.  If, as my colleague Jim\r\nGettys has laboriously measured, the average age of the code base\r\non those ubiquitous low-end routers is 4-5 years,[JG] then you can\r\nbe assured that the CVE catalog lists numerous methods of attacking\r\nthose operating systems and device drivers remotely.[CV]  If I can\r\ncommandeer them remotely, then I can build a botnet that is on the\r\n*outside* of the home network.  It need not ever put a single packet\r\nthrough the firewall, it need never be detectible by any means\r\nwhatsoever from the interior of the network it serves, but it is\r\nmost assuredly a latent weapon, one that can be staged to whatever\r\nlevel of prevalence I desire before I ask it to do more.  All I\r\nneed is to include in my exploit a way to signal that device to do\r\nthree things: stop processing anything it henceforth receives, start\r\nflooding the network with a broadcast signal that causes other peers\r\nto do the same, and zero the on-board firmware thus preventing\r\nreboot for all time.  Now the only way to recover is to unplug all\r\nthe devices, throw them in the dumpster, and install new ones --\r\nbut aren\'t the new ones likely to have the same kind of vulnerability\r\nspectrum in CVE that made this possible in the first place?  Of\r\ncourse they do, so this is not a quick trip to the big box store\r\nbut rather flushing the entire design space and pipeline inventory\r\nof every maker of home routers.  There appears to be an event at\r\nDefCon around this very issue.[SOHO]\r\n\r\nResiliency is an area where no one policy can be sufficient, so\r\nI\'ve suggested a trio of baby steps: embedded systems cannot be\r\nimmortal if they have no remote management interface, embedded\r\nsystems must have a remote management interface if they are to be\r\nimmortal, and swap-over is preferable to swap-out when it comes to\r\ndata protection.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Vulnerability finding -- HEGEMONY\r\n\r\nVulnerability finding is a job.  It has been a job for something\r\nlike eight years now, give or take.  For a good long while, you\r\ncould do vulnerability finding as a hobby and get paid in bragging\r\nrights, but finding vulnerabilities got to be too hard to do as a\r\nhobby in your spare time -- you needed to work it like a job and\r\nget paid like a job.  This was the result of hard work on the part\r\nof the software suppliers including the suppliers of operating\r\nsystems, but as the last of the four verities of government says,\r\nevery solution has side effects.  In this case, the side effect is\r\nthat once vulnerability finding became a job and stopped being a\r\nbragging-rights hobby, those finding the vulnerabilities stopped\r\nsharing.  If you are finding vulns for fun and fame, then the minute\r\nyou find a good one you\'ll let everybody know just to prevent someone\r\nelse finding it and beating you to the punch.  If you are doing it\r\nfor profit, then you don\'t share.  That\'s where the side effect is\r\n-- once coin-operated vuln finders won\'t share, the percentage of\r\nall attacks that are zero-day attacks must rise, and it has.\r\n\r\nIn a May article in The Atlantic,[BS] Bruce Schneier asked a cogent\r\nfirst-principles question: Are vulnerabilities in software dense\r\nor sparse?  If they are sparse, then every one you find and fix\r\nmeaningfully lowers the number of avenues of attack that are extant.\r\nIf they are dense, then finding and fixing one more is essentially\r\nirrelevant to security and a waste of the resources spent finding\r\nit.  Six-take-away-one is a 15% improvement.  Six-thousand-take-\r\naway-one has no detectable value.\r\n\r\nIf a couple of Texas brothers could corner the world silver market,[HB]\r\nthere is no doubt that the U.S. Government could openly corner the\r\nworld vulnerability market, that is we buy them all and we make\r\nthem all public.  Simply announce \"Show us a competing bid, and\r\nwe\'ll give you 10x.\"  Sure, there are some who will say \"I hate\r\nAmericans; I sell only to Ukrainians,\" but because vulnerability\r\nfinding is increasingly automation-assisted, the seller who won\'t\r\nsell to the Americans knows that his vulns can be rediscovered in\r\ndue course by someone who *will* sell to the Americans who will\r\ntell everybody, thus his need to sell his product before it outdates\r\nis irresistible.\r\n\r\nThis strategy\'s usefulness comes from two side effects: (1) that\r\nby overpaying we enlarge the talent pool of vulnerability finders\r\nand (2) that by making public every single vuln the USG buys we\r\ndevalue them.  Put differently, by overpaying we increase the rate\r\nof vuln finding, while by showing everyone what it is that we bought\r\nwe zero out whatever stockpile of cyber weapons our adversaries\r\nhave.  We don\'t need intelligence on what weapons our adversaries\r\nhave if we have something close to a complete inventory of the\r\nworld\'s vulns and have shared that with all the affected software\r\nsuppliers.  But this begs Schneier\'s question: Are vulnerabilities\r\nsparse or dense?  If they are sparse or even merely numerous, then\r\ncornering the market wins in due course.  If they are dense, then\r\nall we would end up doing is increasing costs both to software\r\nsuppliers now obligated to repair all the vulns a growing army of\r\nvuln researchers can find and to taxpayers.  I believe that vulns\r\nare scarce enough for this to work and,, therefore I believe that\r\ncornering the market is the cheapest win we will ever get.\r\n\r\nLet me note, however, that my colleagues in static analysis report\r\nthat they regularly see web applications greater than 2GB in size\r\nand with 20,000 variables.  Such web apps can only have been written\r\nby machine and, therefore, the vulns found in them were also written\r\nby machine.  Machine-powered vuln creation might change my analysis\r\nthough I can\'t yet say in what direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Right to be forgotten -- YES\r\n\r\nI\'ve spoken elsewhere about how we are all intelligence agents now,\r\ncollecting on each other on behalf of various overlords.[RSA]  There\r\nare so many technologies now that power observation and identification\r\nof the individual at a distance.  They may not yet be in your pocket\r\nor on your dashboard or embedded in all your smoke detectors, but\r\nthat is only a matter of time.  Your digital exhaust is unique hence\r\nit identifies.  Pooling everyone\'s digital exhaust also characterizes\r\nhow you differ from normal.  Privacy used to be proportional to\r\nthat which it is impossible to observe or that which can be observed\r\nbut not identified.  No more -- what is today observable and\r\nidentifiable kills both privacy as impossible-to-observe and privacy\r\nas impossible-to-identify, so what might be an alternative?  If you\r\nare an optimist or an apparatchik, then your answer will tend toward\r\nrules of data procedure administered by a government you trust or\r\ncontrol.  If you are a pessimist or a hacker/maker, then your answer\r\nwill tend towards the operational, and your definition of a state\r\nof privacy will be my definition: the effective capacity to\r\nmisrepresent yourself.\r\n\r\nMisrepresentation is using disinformation to frustrate data fusion\r\non the part of whomever it is that is watching you.  Some of it can\r\nbe low-tech, such as misrepresentation by paying your therapist in\r\ncash under an assumed name.  Misrepresentation means arming yourself\r\nnot at Walmart but in living rooms.  Misrepresentation means swapping\r\naffinity cards at random with like-minded folks.  Misrepresentation\r\nmeans keeping an inventory of misconfigured webservers to proxy\r\nthrough.  Misrepresentation means putting a motor-generator between\r\nyou and the Smart Grid.  Misrepresentation means using Tor for no\r\nreason at all.  Misrepresentation means hiding in plain sight when\r\nthere is nowhere else to hide.  Misrepresentation means having not\r\none digital identity that you cherish, burnish, and protect, but\r\nhaving as many as you can.  Your fused identity is not a question\r\nunless you work to make it be.  Lest you think that this is a problem\r\nstatement for the random paranoid individual alone, let me tell you\r\nthat in the big-I Intelligence trade, crafting good cover is getting\r\nharder and harder and for the exact same reasons: misrepresentation\r\nis getting harder and harder.  If I was running field operations,\r\nI would not try to fabricate a complete digital identity, I\'d\r\n\"borrow\" the identity of someone who had the characteristics that\r\nI needed for the case at hand.\r\n\r\nThe Obama administration\'s issuance of a National Strategy for\r\nTrusted Identities in Cyberspace[NS] is case-in-point; it \"calls\r\nfor the development of interoperable technology standards and\r\npolicies -- an \'Identity Ecosystem\' -- where individuals, organizations,\r\nand underlying infrastructure -- such as routers and servers -- can\r\nbe authoritatively authenticated.\"  If you can trust a digital\r\nidentity, that is because it can\'t be faked.  Why does the government\r\ncare about this?  It cares because it wants to digitally deliver\r\ngovernment services and it wants attribution.  Is having a non-fake-able\r\ndigital identity for government services worth the registration of\r\nyour remaining secrets with that government?  Is there any real\r\ndifference between a system that permits easy, secure, identity-based\r\nservices and a surveillance system?  Do you trust those who hold\r\nsurveillance data on you over the long haul by which I mean the\r\nindefinite retention of transactional data between government\r\nservices and you, the individual required to proffer a non-fake-able\r\nidentity to engage in those transactions?  Assuming this spreads\r\nwell beyond the public sector, which is its designers\' intent, do\r\nyou want this everywhere?  If you are building authentication systems\r\ntoday, then you are already playing ball in this league.  If you\r\nare using authentication systems today, then you are subject to the\r\npending design decisions of people who are themselves playing ball\r\nin this league.\r\n\r\nAfter a good amount of waffling, I conclude that a unitary, unfakeable\r\ndigital identity is no bargain and that I don\'t want one.  I want\r\nto choose whether to misrepresent myself.  I may rarely use that,\r\nbut it is my right to do so.  If that right vanishes into the\r\npanopticon, I have lost something and, in my view, gained next to\r\nnothing.  In that regard, and acknowledging that it is a baby step,\r\nI conclude that the EU\'s \"Right to be Forgotten\" is both appropriate\r\nand advantageous though it does not go far enough.  Being forgotten\r\nis consistent with moving to a new town to start over, to changing\r\nyour name, to a definition of privacy that turns on whether you do\r\nor do not retain the effective capacity to misrepresent yourself,\r\na right which I will remind you is routinely granted but to those\r\nwho have especially helped governmental causes (witness protection,\r\ne.g.).  A right to be forgotten is the only check on the tidal wave\r\nof observability that a ubiquitous sensor fabric is birthing now,\r\nobservability that changes the very quality of what \"in public\"\r\nmeans.  Entities that block deep-linking to their web resources are\r\nneutralizing indexability.  Governments of all stripes, irretrievably\r\nbalkanizing the Internet through the self-same vehicle of indexing\r\ncontrols, are claiming that a right to do so is inherently theirs.\r\nThe only democratizing brake on this runaway train is for individuals\r\nto be able, in their own small way, to do the same as do other\r\nentities.  I find it notably ironic that The Guardian newspaper\'s\r\nchampioning of Edward Snowden\'s revelations about privacy loss is\r\npaired with the same paper\'s editorializing that \"No one has a right\r\nto be forgotten.\"[GRF]  Au contraire, madames et monsieurs, they\r\nmost assuredly do.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. Internet voting -- NO\r\n\r\nMotivated & expert opponents are very nearly undefendable against.\r\nPeople like us here know that, which is why it is natural for people\r\nlike us here to oppose voting over the Internet.  The National\r\nCenter for Policy Analysis thinks online voting is a bad idea.  NIST\r\nthinks online voting is a bad idea.  With Pamela Smith, Bruce\r\nMcConnell editorialized in the pages of the Wall Street Journal[BMC]\r\nthat online voting is a bad idea.  The fact that we here have near\r\nuniversal disdain for the idea has not seemed to change much policy.\r\n\r\nNow it is always true that a thorough security analysis will get\r\nmuch less attention than a juicy conspiracy theory even if both\r\nlead to the same conclusion.  How do we explain this?  If I knew\r\nthat, then I would commence to explaining, but we may not need to\r\nexplain it if the integrity of some election is put at question by\r\nevents.  I\'d like to think that we don\'t need carnage to motivate\r\na re-think, but perhaps we do.  If we do need carnage, then may its\r\ncoming be sooner rather than later.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. Abandonment -- CERTAINTY OF CONSEQUENCES\r\n\r\nIf I abandon a car on the street, then eventually someone will be\r\nable to claim title.  If I abandon a bank account, then the State\r\nwill eventually seize it.  If I abandon real estate by failing to\r\nremedy a trespass, then in the fullness of time adverse possession\r\ntakes over.  If I don\'t use my trademark, then my rights go over\r\nto those who use what was and could have remained mine.  If I abandon\r\nmy spouse and/or children, then everyone is taxed to remedy my\r\nactions.  If I abandon a patent application, then after a date\r\ncertain the teaching that it proposes passes over to the rest of\r\nyou.  If I abandon my hold on the confidentiality of data such as\r\nby publishing it, then that data passes over to the commonweal not\r\nto return.  If I abandon my storage locker, then it will be lost\r\nto me and may end up on reality TV.  The list goes on.\r\n\r\nApple computers running 10.5 or less get no updates (comprising a\r\nsignificant fraction of the installed base).  Any Microsoft computer\r\nrunning XP gets no updates (likewise comprising a significant\r\nfraction of the installed base).  The end of security updates follows\r\nabandonment.  It is certainly ironic that freshly pirated copies\r\nof Windows get security updates when older versions bought legitimately\r\ndo not.\r\n\r\nStating what to me is the obvious policy stance, if Company X\r\nabandons a code base, then that code base must be open sourced.\r\nIrrespective of security issues, many is the time that a bit of\r\nsoftware I use has gone missing because its maker killed it.  But\r\nwith respect to security, some constellation of {I,we,you,they} are\r\nwilling and able to provide security patches or workarounds as time\r\nand evil require.\r\n\r\nWould the public interest not be served by a conversion to open\r\nsource for abandoned code bases?  I believe it would.  But wait,\r\nyou say, isn\'t purchased software on a general purpose computer a\r\nthing of the past?  Isn\'t the future all about auto-updated smartphone\r\nclients transacting over armored private (carrier) networks to\r\nauto-updated cloud services?  Maybe; maybe not.  If the two major\r\ndesktop suppliers update only half of today\'s desktops, then what\r\npercentage will they update tomorrow?\r\n\r\nIf you say \"Make them try harder!,\" then the legalistic, regulatory\r\nposition is your position, and the ACLU is already trying that\r\nroute.  If smartphone auto-update becomes a condition of merchantability\r\nand your smartphone holds the keying material that undeniably says\r\nthat its user is you, then how long before a FISA court orders a\r\nspecial auto-update to *your* phone for evidence gathering?\r\n\r\nIf you say \"But we already know what they\'re going to do, don\'t\r\nwe?,\" then the question is what about the abandoned code bases.\r\nOpen-sourcing abandoned code bases is the worst option, except for\r\nall the others.  But if seizing an abandoned code base is too big\r\na stretch for you before breakfast, then start with a Public Key\r\nInfrastructure Certifying Authority that goes bankrupt and ask \"Who\r\ngets the keys?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n10. Convergence -- DEFAULT DENY\r\n\r\nLet me ask you a question: Are the physical and digital worlds one\r\nworld or two?  Are cyberspace and meatspace converging or diverging\r\nover time?  I conclude that they are converging, but if they are\r\nconverging, then is cyberspace looking more and more like meatspace\r\nor is meatspace looking more and more like cyberspace?  That is not\r\nso clear.\r\n\r\nPossibility #1 is that cyberspace becomes more and more like\r\nmeatspace, ergo the re-creation of borders and jurisdictional\r\nboundaries is what happens next.  Possibility #2 is that meatspace\r\nbecomes more and more like cyberspace, ergo jurisdictional boundaries\r\ngrow increasingly irrelevant and something akin to one-world\r\ntechnocratic government more or less follows.  The former is\r\nheterogeneous, the latter is the monoculture of a single nation-state.\r\nAs we all know, resiliency and freedom obtain solely from heterogeneity,\r\nso converging meatspace to cyberspace is the unfavorable outcome,\r\nbut what can be done about it?\r\n\r\nAt the end of last year, the Pew Research Center invited 12,000\r\n\"experts\" to answer a single Yes/No question:\r\n\r\n   By 2025 will there be significant changes for the worse and\r\n   hindrances to the ways in which people get and share content\r\n   online compared with the way globally networked people can operate\r\n   online today?[PEW]\r\n\r\nOf the 12,000 invited, some 1,400 did answer.  Putting aside whatever\r\nselection bias may be reflected in who chose to answer and who did\r\nnot, Pew found four themes dominated respondent comments:\r\n\r\n  1) Actions by nation-states to maintain security and political\r\n  control will lead to more blocking, filtering, segmentation, and\r\n  balkanization of the Internet.\r\n\r\n  2) Trust will evaporate in the wake of revelations about government\r\n  and corporate surveillance and likely greater surveillance in the\r\n  future.\r\n\r\n  3) Commercial pressures affecting everything from Internet\r\n  architecture to the flow of information will endanger the open\r\n  structure of online life.\r\n\r\n  4) Efforts to fix the \"too much information\" problem might\r\n  over-compensate and actually thwart content sharing.\r\n\r\nMy colleague Rob Lemos mapped Pew\'s themes to the two alternative\r\nfutures I mentioned above,[RL] saying that \"If cyberspace converges\r\nto our physical reality, then we will have balkanization and\r\ncommercial efforts to artificially create information monopolies,\r\nwhile if the physical world goes toward digital space, then we have\r\ngreater surveillance, the erosion of trust, much information leakage,\r\nand the reaction to that leakage.\"  More crucially, Lemos also\r\nobserved that the growth of technology has greatly increased personal\r\npower:\r\n\r\n  The impact that a single person can have on society has significantly\r\n  increased over time to where a single individual can have a\r\n  devastating effect.  The natural reaction for government is to\r\n  become more invasive {possibility #2 above} to better defend its\r\n  monoculture, or more separate {possibility #1 above} to firewall\r\n  threats from one another.  Because threats and kinetic impacts\r\n  can increasingly travel through the digital realm, they necessitate\r\n  that the policy and legal frameworks of the digital and physical\r\n  world converge.\r\n\r\nIn other words, Lemos argues that convergence is an inevitable\r\nconsequence of the very power of cyberspace in and of itself.  I\r\ndon\'t argue with Lemos\' idea that increasingly powerful, location\r\nindependent technology in the hands of the many will tend to force\r\nchanges in the distribution of power.  In fact, that is the central\r\ntheme of this essay -- that the power that is growing in the net,\r\nper se, will soon surpass the ability of our existing institutions\r\nto modify it in any meaningful way, so either the net must be broken\r\nup into governable chunks or the net becomes government.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the leverage here favors cyberspace whenever\r\nand wherever we give cyberspace a monopoly position, which we are\r\ndoing that blindly and often.  In the last couple of years, I\'ve\r\nfound that institutions that I more or less must use -- my 401(k)\r\ncustodian, the Government Accounting Office\'s accounts payable\r\ndepartment, the payroll service my employer outsources to, etc. --\r\nno longer accept paper letter instructions, they each only accept\r\ndigital delivery of such instructions.  This means that each of\r\nthem has created a critical dependence on an Internet swarming with\r\nmen in the middle and, which is more, they have doubtlessly given\r\nup their own ability to fall back to what worked for a century\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nIt is that giving up of alternative means that really defines what\r\nconvergence is and does.  It is said that all civil wars are about\r\non whose terms re-unification will occur.  I would argue that we\r\nare in, to coin a phrase, a Cold Civil War to determine on whose\r\nterms convergence occurs.  Everything in meatspace we give over to\r\ncyberspace replaces dependencies that are local and manageable with\r\ndependencies that are certainly not local and I would argue much\r\nless manageable because they are much less secure.  I say that\r\nbecause the root cause of risk is dependence, and most especially\r\ndependence on expectations of system state.  I say \"much less secure\"\r\nbecause one is secure, that is to say that one is in a state of\r\nsecurity, if and only if there can be no unmitigatable surprises.\r\nThe more we put on the Internet, the broader and unmitigatable any\r\nsurprises become.\r\n\r\nThis line of thought is beginning to sink in.  Let me quote from a\r\nBloomberg article a month ago:[CWC]\r\n\r\n  Wall Street\'s biggest trade group has proposed a government-industry\r\n  cyber war council to stave off terrorist attacks that could trigger\r\n  financial panic by temporarily wiping out account balances,\r\n  according to an internal document.\r\n\r\n  The proposal by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets\r\n  Association calls for a committee of executives and deputy-level\r\n  representatives from at least eight U.S. agencies including the\r\n  Treasury Department, the National Security Agency and the Department\r\n  of Homeland Security, all led by a senior White House official.\r\n\r\n  The document sketches an unusually frank and pessimistic view by\r\n  the industry of its readiness for attacks wielded by nation-states\r\n  or terrorist groups that aim to \"destroy data and machines.\"  It\r\n  says the concerns are \"compounded by the dependence of financial\r\n  institutions on the electric grid,\" which is also vulnerable to\r\n  physical and cyber attack.\r\n\r\nSo here you have the biggest financial firms saying that their\r\ndependencies are no longer manageable, and that the State\'s monopoly\r\non the use of force must be brought to bear.  What they are talking\r\nabout is that they have no way to mitigate the risk of common mode\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nTo repeat, risk is a consequence of dependence.  Because of shared\r\ndependence, aggregate societal dependence on the Internet is not\r\nestimable.  If dependencies are not estimable, they will be\r\nunderestimated.  If they are underestimated, they will not be made\r\nsecure over the long run, only over the short.  As the risks become\r\nincreasingly unlikely to appear, the interval between events will\r\ngrow longer.  As the latency between events grows, the assumption\r\nthat safety has been achieved will also grow, thus fueling increased\r\ndependence in what is now a positive feedback loop.  Accommodating\r\nold methods and Internet rejectionists preserves alternate, less\r\ncomplex, more durable means and therefore bounds dependence.  Bounding\r\ndependence is *the* core of rational risk management.\r\n\r\nIf we don\'t bound dependence, we invite common mode failure.  In\r\nthe language of statistics, common mode failure comes exactly from\r\nunder-appreciated mutual dependence.  Quoting [NIST]:\r\n\r\n   [R]edundancy is the provision of functional capabilities that\r\n   would be unnecessary in a fault-free environment.  Redundancy\r\n   is necessary, but not sufficient for fault tolerance... System\r\n   failures occur when faults propagate to the outer boundary of\r\n   the system.  The goal of fault tolerance is to intercept the\r\n   propagation of faults so that failure does not occur, usually\r\n   by substituting redundant functions for functions affected by a\r\n   particular fault.  Occasionally, a fault may affect enough\r\n   redundant functions that it is not possible to reliably select\r\n   a non-faulty result, and the system will sustain a common-mode\r\n   failure.  A common-mode failure results from a single fault (or\r\n   fault set).  Computer systems are vulnerable to common-mode\r\n   resource failures if they rely on a single source of power,\r\n   cooling, or I/O.  A more insidious source of common-mode failures\r\n   is a design fault that causes redundant copies of the same\r\n   software process to fail under identical conditions.\r\n\r\nThat last part -- that \"A more insidious source of common-mode\r\nfailures is a design fault that causes redundant copies of the same\r\nsoftware process to fail under identical conditions\" -- is exactly\r\nthat which can be masked by complexity precisely because complexity\r\nensures under-appreciated mutual dependence.\r\n\r\nIn sum, as a matter of policy everything that is officially categorized\r\nas a critical infrastructure must conclusively show how it can\r\noperate in the absence of the Internet.  The 2008 financial crisis\r\nproved that we can build systems more complex than we can operate,\r\nthe best policy counter to which has been the system of \"stress\r\ntests\" thereafter administered to the banks.  We need other kinds\r\nof stress tests even more.\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nI titled this talk \"Cybersecurity as Realpolitik.\"  Realpolitik\r\nmeans, in the words of British historian E. H. Carr, that what is\r\nsuccessful is right and what is unsuccessful is wrong, that there\r\nis no moral dimension in how the world is, and that attempting to\r\ngovern based on principles cannot succeed.  Realpolitik is at once\r\natheistic and anti-utopian.\r\n\r\nI find that distasteful and, it seems, that in governing my own\r\nlife I daily give up power advantage for principle.  At the same\r\ntime, having principles such as \"Might does not make right\" may\r\nwell be a failing on my part and, by extension, a failing on the\r\npart of those who govern according to principle.  Cybersecurity as\r\nwe describe it in our mailing lists, on our blogs, at our cons, and\r\nso forth is rich in principles and utopian desiderata, all the while\r\nwe have opponents at all levels and probably always will for whom\r\nprinciple matters little but power matters a lot.  As Thomas Ray\r\nsaid, \"Every successful system accumulates parasites\" and the\r\nInternet plus every widely popular application on it has parasites.\r\nFor some observers, parasites and worse are just a cost of doing\r\nbusiness.  For other observers, design which encourages bad outcomes\r\nis an affront that must be fixed.  It is realism and realism alone\r\nthat remains when all else fails.\r\n\r\nPolitical realism of the sort I am talking about is based on four\r\npremises:\r\n\r\n. The international system is anarchic\r\n. States are the most important actors\r\n. All states within the system are unitary, rational actors\r\n. The primary concern of all states is survival\r\n\r\nThis is likewise the realism of the cybersecurity situation in a\r\nglobal Internet.  It is anarchic, and states have become the most\r\nimportant actors.  States\' investment in offensive cyber is entirely\r\nabout survival in such a world.  States are driven to this by the\r\ndual, simultaneous expansion of what is possible and what their\r\ncitizens choose to depend on.\r\n\r\nThe late Peter Bernstein, perhaps the world\'s foremost thinker on\r\nthe topic, defined \"risk\" as \"more things can happen than will.\"[PB]\r\nWith technologic advance accelerating, \"more things can happen than\r\nwill\" takes on a particularly ominous quality if your job is to\r\nensure your citizens\' survival in an anarchy where, daily, ever\r\nmore things can happen than will.  Realpolitik would say that under\r\nsuch circumstances, defense becomes irrelevant.  What is relevant\r\nis either (1) offense or (2) getting out of the line of fire\r\naltogether.  States that are investing in offense are being entirely\r\nrational and are likely to survive.  Those of us who are backing\r\nout our remaining dependencies on digital goods and services are\r\nbeing entirely rational and are likely to survive.  The masses who\r\nquickly depend on every new thing are effectively risk seeking, and\r\neven if they do not themselves know it, the States which own them\r\nknow, which explains why every State now does to its own citizens\r\nwhat once States only did to officials in competing regimes.\r\n\r\nYou have politely listened to a series of \"get off the dime\" policy\r\nproposals around mandatory reporting, net neutrality, source code\r\nliability, strike back, fall backs, resiliency, vulnerability\r\nfinding, the right to be forgotten, Internet voting, abandonment,\r\nand convergence, all by one guy that no one ever elected.  I thank\r\nyou, friends and countrymen, for lending me your ears.  But I shall\r\nbe happier still if some one or several of you find the articulateness\r\nthat overcomes the dynamic which we now inhabit, namely that if\r\nwhat is successful is right and what is unsuccessful is wrong, the\r\nobservable allocation of success and of failure is utterly disconnected\r\nfrom the technical facts of cybersecurity as we know them here.  In\r\nthe end, reality always wins, and the reality of technical facts\r\nhas more staying power than the reality of market share or utopian\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, cybersecurity is all about power and only power.\r\nRealpolitik says that what cybersecurity works is right and what\r\ncybersecurity does not work is wrong and Realpolitik thus resonates\r\nwith Howard\'s \"Security will always be exactly as bad as it can\r\npossibly be while allowing everything to still function.\"  Realpolitik\r\nsays that offense routinely beating defense is right, and imagining\r\notherwise is wrong, that those whose offense wins are right while\r\nthose whose defense loses are wrong.  Realpolitik says that offense\'s\r\nsuperiority means that it a utopian fantasy to believe that information\r\ncan be protected from leakage, and so the counter-offense of\r\ndisinformation is what we must deploy in return.  Realpolitik says\r\nthat sentient opponents have always been a fact of life, but never\r\nbefore have they been location independent and never before have\r\nthey been able to recruit mercenaries who will work for free.\r\nRealpolitik says that attribution is impossible unless we deploy a\r\nunitary surveillance state.\r\n\r\nI have long preferred to hire security people who are, more than\r\nanything else, sadder but wiser.  They, and only they, know that\r\nmost of what commercially succeeds succeeds only so long as attackers\r\ndo not give it their attention while what commercially fails fails\r\nnot because it didn\'t work but because it wasn\'t cheap or easy or\r\nsexy enough to try.  Their glasses are not rose-colored; they are\r\nspattered with Realpolitik.  Sadder but wiser hires, however, come\r\nonly from people who have experienced private tragedies, not global\r\nones.  There are no people sadder but wiser about the scale and\r\nscope of the attack surface you get when you connect everything to\r\neverything and give up your prior ability to do without.  Until\r\nsuch people are available, I will busy myself with reducing my\r\ndependence on, and thus my risk exposure to, the digital world even\r\nthough that will be mistaken for curmudgeonly nostalgia.  Call that\r\nmisrepresentation, if you like.\r\n\r\nThere is never enough time.

You can even embed <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/30/feature-plugin-merge-proposal-oembed/\">previews of posts</a> from other WordPress sites by pasting the URL on its own line.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There have been a lot of changes for developers to play with as well:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>REST API (phase 1) </strong>— The underlying infrastructure of the WordPress REST API <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/\">plugin</a> has been <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/21/wp-rest-api-merge-proposal/\">included in WordPress 4.4</a>.

Also, the underlying <code>WP_Term</code> class improves caching when working with terms. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14162\">#14162</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>Improved <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> output</strong> — <code>wp_title()</code> is now deprecated; WordPress can <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/20/document-title-in-4-4/\">handle the rendering</a> of the document title automatically.</li>\n<li><strong>Comments </strong>— Comment queries are now split for performance.

The guide explains how and where to provide feedback and how important it is to beta test new features.</p>\n<p>Over the years, I&#8217;ve used WP Tavern to advocate for and against features in WordPress. One of the best pieces of advice I can give non-developers is to organize your thoughts or stance on a specific feature or direction and publish them on your site. This allows you to control the conversation and gives you plenty of space to explain your perspective.</p>\n<p>A great example <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/help-me-add-comment-approval-notifications-to-wordpress\">is this post</a> asking for help to add comment moderation approval notifications to WordPress. I explain why it&#8217;s needed with a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33717\">link to the ticket</a> I created to keep track of the conversation. I prefer to write about potential features and based on feedback, I&#8217;ll either create a trac ticket myself or someone will do it for me with a link to the post.</p>\n<p>The Tavern is in the dashboard and is read by a large audience, including core developers. However, thanks to social media, a well constructed post with solid points will make the rounds on Twitter, Facebook, and within WordPress sub-communities.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s those posts and associated comments that serve as one of many foundations for change in WordPress without touching a line of code. Keep in mind that there&#8217;s no guarantee you&#8217;ll be able to directly influence WordPress core development with words alone, but respectful, in-depth conversations with differing opinions and perspectives are an important part of the community regardless.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 04 Nov 2015 08:42:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"WPTavern: Daniel Bachhuber Raises More Than $17.5K to Develop a RESTful WP-CLI\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=48819\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"http://wptavern.com/daniel-bachhuber-raises-more-than-17-5k-to-develop-a-restful-wp-cli\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1664:\"<p><a href=\"https://danielbachhuber.com/\">Daniel Bachhuber</a>, who maintains <a href=\"http://wp-cli.org/\">WP-CLI</a>, has successfully raised more than $21K through his <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/danielbachhuber/a-more-restful-wp-cli\">Kickstarter campaign</a>. He created the campaign to generate funding to develop a CLI interface for the WordPress REST API.</p>\n<p>According to Bachhuber, the project will allow WordPress REST API endpoints registered via plugins and themes to automatically be usable as WP-CLI commands. Developers will also be able to push and pull posts including, custom post types, users, and other WordPress REST API data between separate WordPress installations with a simple WP-CLI command.</p>\n<p>Bachhuber requested $17.5K and within twelve hours of publishing the campaign, he received more than the asking amount from 51 backers, including one who contributed $8,500. Bachhuber will donate one hour of time to the WordPress REST API project in 2016 for every $100 over the funding goal.

In response to requests, Aaron Jorbin, WordPress core contributor, reemphasized <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/#decisions\">WordPress&#8217; philosophy</a> on adding options.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Every time you give a user an option, you are asking them to make a decision. When a user doesn’t care or understand the option this ultimately leads to frustration. As developers we sometimes feel that providing options for everything is a good thing, you can never have too many choices, right?</p>\n<p>Ultimately these choices end up being technical ones, choices that the average end-user has no interest in. It’s our duty as developers to make smart design decisions and avoid putting the weight of technical choices on our end users.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Birchler also responded saying, &#8220;The new embed functionality was developed with the majority of users in mind.&#8221; One of the largest problems with adding to options to WordPress is that they&#8217;re difficult to remove.</p>\n<p>Some WordPress developers are excited to see how post embeds can be extended. <a href=\"http://hughlashbrooke.com/\">Hugh Lashbrooke</a>, who works for Automattic, thinks post embeds will be great for Custom Post Types, &#8220;I think the oEmbed feature has loads of awesome use cases for Custom Post Types. For example, being able to embed eCommerce products on other sites with dynamic add to cart links,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The easiest way to try post embeds is to log into <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/test-new-wordpress-features-without-installing-anything-via-trywpbeta\">TryWPBeta</a> using these credentials.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Username</strong>: wcpdx</li>\n<li><strong>Password</strong>: wcpdx15</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Create a new post and make sure the visual editor is selected.

Joe McGill, who is helping to merge the feature to core, joined me for a thirty minute interview to explain how it works.</p>\n<p>When users upload images in WordPress, it automatically crops new images to smaller sizes. For example, if you upload an image that&#8217;s 1500 x 706, the image sizes might look like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full Size &#8211; 1500 x 706</li>\n<li>Large &#8211; 500 x 235</li>\n<li>Medium &#8211; 300 x 141</li>\n<li>Thumbnail &#8211; 150 x 150</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional sizes are created depending on the theme. If the full size image is attached to a post, users on desktop and mobile devices will see the full size image. However, it doesn&#8217;t make sense to use the full size image on mobile devices because of its display and file size.</p>\n<p>Responsive images in WordPress 4.4 adds <code>srcset</code>&nbsp;and <code>sizes</code> support to WordPress. This allows the software to automatically use and display the right image based on a device&#8217;s screen size. If I attach a full size 1500 x 706 image to a post in WordPress 4.4, mobile devices will see the large or medium-sized image instead.</p>\n<p>Responsive images don&#8217;t have any settings to configure as the magic happens behind the scenes. I encourage you to listen to the interview as it may be easier to understand listening to us talk through the feature.</p>\n<div class=\"audio-shortcode-wrap\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ResponsiveImagesinWordPress.png?resize=175%2C131\" alt=\"Responsive Images in WordPress\" class=\"landscape thumbnail post-thumbnail audio-image\" /><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement(\'audio\');</script><![endif]-->\n<a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Joe-McGill-Explains-Responsive-Images-in-WordPress.mp3\">http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Joe-McGill-Explains-Responsive-Images-in-WordPress.mp3</a></div><div class=\"media-shortcode-extend\"><div class=\"media-info audio-info\"><ul class=\"media-meta\"><li><span class=\"prep\">Run Time</span> <span class=\"data\">26:50</span></li><li><span class=\"prep\">Artist</span> <span class=\"data\">Jeff Chandler</span></li><li><span class=\"prep\">File Name</span> <span class=\"data\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Joe-McGill-Explains-Responsive-Images-in-WordPress.mp3\">Joe-McGill-Explains-Responsive-Images-in-WordPress.mp3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"prep\">File Size</span> <span class=\"data\">12.09 MB</span></li><li><span class=\"prep\">File Type</span> <span class=\"data\">MP3</span></li><li><span class=\"prep\">Mime Type</span> <span class=\"data\">audio/mpeg</span></li></ul></div><button class=\"media-info-toggle\">Audio Info</button></div>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 29 Oct 2015 00:43:12 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WPTavern: The WordPress Theme Directory No Longer Counts Automated Downloads\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=48766\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-theme-directory-no-longer-counts-automated-downloads\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5745:\"<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/browse/popular/\">popular themes page</a> on the WordPress theme directory usually displays a mix of default themes and those that meet a certain criteria. While the criteria to reach the page is not publicly known, download counts are one form of measurement.</p>\n<p>Since September, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/swift/\">Swift theme</a> has routinely shown up on the popular themes page. According to download stats, Swift was downloaded between, 2,000 to 3,500 times a day in September and early October.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SwiftThemeDownloadNumbers.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-48767\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SwiftThemeDownloadNumbers.png?resize=665%2C500\" alt=\"Swift Download Count\" /></a>Swift Download Count\n<p>However, the stats drop off abruptly on October 15th and have yet to reach previous levels. On October 18th, a few members inside the Theme Review Team Slack channel <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/themereview/p1445155458000095\">shared suspicions</a> that something was not right with Swift&#8217;s download stats.</p>\n<p>Ionut Neagu discovered that Swift does not appear on the <a href=\"https://garage.godaddy.com/top-100-wordpress-themes/\">GoDaddy Hot 100</a> while other themes on the popular page do. While not conclusive, the evidence points towards some sort of anomaly.</p>\n<p>Samuel &#8216;Otto&#8217; Wood, who helps maintain WordPress.org <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/themereview/p1445180169000105\">looked at the raw</a> data for Swift and discovered that a lot of the downloads appeared to be automated.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The swift theme is indeed getting an exceptional number of downloads, so I took a closer look at the raw data. It appears that a lot of these downloads are automated in some way. However, there&#8217;s no evidence that it is malicious, nor does the pattern apply only to the swift theme. Perhaps it is included in some installer system that auto-downloads themes for newly installed sites. It&#8217;s hard to say.</p>\n<p>In any case, I made a way to detect and block these types of automated downloads from appearing in the stats, and retroactively applied it for the last three days of data (which is all we retain). Going forward, automated downloads will not appear as downloads and will not affect the popular listings.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Once the changes were implemented, Swift&#8217;s download stats significantly decreased. The changes also apply to all other themes hosted on the directory. Otto declined to comment on the specific changes made but tells the Tavern, &#8220;If we can detect a case where downloads aren&#8217;t being made by users, then we will try not to count it in the results.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Swift’s Side of the Story</h2>\n<p>Satish Gandham, founder of <a href=\"https://swiftthemes.com/\">Swiftthemes</a>, explains what Swift has gone through the last few weeks which may account for the high download numbers, &#8220;Swift was featured for a couple of days and we spent money on Facebook ads to promote the free version. Also, there were a couple of hosted WordPress providers who asked permission to include Swift on their platform.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The premium version of Swift also had the same slug URL as the free version. The WordPress theme directory saw v7.2.48 to be higher than 7.2.6 and premium users downgraded to the free version thinking it was an upgrade. It was a support nightmare,&#8221; Gandham tells the Tavern.</p>\n<p>Swift&#8217;s <a href=\"https://swiftthemes.com/forums/topic/how-to-returning-to-version-7-2-6/\">support forums</a> confirm that some customers of the commercial version were automatically updated to the free version in early August.</p>\n<h2>Download Counts are Almost Irrelevant</h2>\n<p>When the <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-directory-launches-new-design\">plugin directory was redesigned</a> earlier this year, download counts were removed in favor of active installs. Active installs are more accurate and difficult to manipulate. On the other hand, when the <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-directory-launches-new-design\">theme directory was redesigned</a>, download counts remained.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s possible that the theme directory will one day show active installs but the data gathering aspect is not ready yet. Also, the numbers are lower for themes than for plugins, which may lead to incorrect conclusions in regards to relative popularity.</p>\n<h2>It Happens More Than You Might Think</h2>\n<p>In this particular instance, there&#8217;s no evidence that points to a malicious intent to inflate stats to manipulate the popular themes page. In the years I&#8217;ve written about WordPress, I&#8217;ve heard rumors that certain plugins and themes automate their download counts to appear more popular than they really are. However, I&#8217;ve yet to write about a theme or plugin caught in the act.</p>\n<p>According to Otto, it happens more often than you might think. When he or other volunteer moderators for the plugin and theme directories notice fishy download counts, they contact the author and the process usually stops. If it continues, the author risks having their themes and plugins suspended or banned from the directory.</p>\n<p>If you notice suspicious activity with a theme hosted on WordPress.org, you can voice your concern in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Theme Review Slack</a> channel during non-meeting times.

That&#8217;s because the <a href=\"https://managewp.com/developer-diary-9-managewp-orion-is-out\">company released Orion</a>, a completely redesigned dashboard for managing sites.</p>\n<p>To give users a chance to alter workflows and explore the Orion dashboard, ManageWP linked the original dashboard to Orion. Actions performed in one dashboard are mirrored to the other. Users can switch between the two with the click of a button.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ManageWPOrianOldNew.gif\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-48757\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ManageWPOrianOldNew.gif?resize=638%2C512\" alt=\"ManageWP Dashboard Compared to Orion\" /></a>ManageWP Dashboard Compared to Orion\n<p>Users can now sort sites by tags and clients in addition to groups. Websites can be assigned to clients while tags can describe whether a site is in development or live. Each site can up to five tags and one client.</p>\n<p>Unlike the native dashboard, Orion uses Angular.js which allows users to run asynchronous calls. For example, you can run more than one command why performing other tasks.</p>\n<p>One distinct difference between both dashboards is the way backups are generated. ManageWP backups and Orion backups are <a href=\"https://managewp.com/managewp-orion-developer-diary-3-bulletproof-backup-solution\">completely different</a> from each other. However, you can use both at the same time.</p>\n<p>The company says Orion comes with essential features but additional features will be completed and added by February of 2016 which is also when Orion will become the default dashboard. WordPress Multisite is not supported as the company cites it as a major undertaking and doesn&#8217;t consider it a high priority.</p>\n<p>The new dashboard contains more features than what&#8217;s listed here. I encourage you to read the <a href=\"https://managewp.com/developer-diary-9-managewp-orion-is-out\">official announcement</a> and if you&#8217;re a customer, to explore Orion as it will soon be the default experience to managing sites. If you&#8217;re a ManageWP customer, let us know what you think of the new dashboard design.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 27 Oct 2015 18:09:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:97:\"WPTavern: How to Prepare and Take Advantage of Language Packs for Plugins Hosted on WordPress.org\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=48727\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"http://wptavern.com/how-to-prepare-and-take-advantage-of-language-packs-for-plugins-hosted-on-wordpress-org\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15607:\"<hr />\n<p>This is a guest post contributed by <a href=\"https://mpswp.wordpress.com/\">Matthew Sparrow</a> who is a young, self-taught developer with minimal coding knowledge that loves to use WordPress. He mostly uses WordPress for personal projects although he has completed a couple of projects for others. In addition to <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/kidsguide/\">maintaining a few plugins</a>, he&#8217;s an active translations contributor.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Automatic translations for plugins have been a long time coming. WordPress itself already auto-downloads and auto-updates core translations, so it is a natural progression that plugins and themes will receive the same treatment.</p>\n<p>For those who have been following auto plugin translations, it has <a href=\"http://ottopress.com/2013/language-packs-101-prepwork/\">been in the works for years</a>. It came as a welcome surprise in September when it was announced that plugins will <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2015/09/01/plugin-translations-on-wordpress-org/\">finally be able to have language packs</a>.</p>\n<p>If you have a plugin in the WordPress.org directory, then this is important, welcome, and exciting news. However, as great as an initiative as language packs are for plugins, it <em>seems</em> simpler than it actually is.</p>\n<p>If you are a plugin developer, you have to go through a few steps in order to get this to work for your plugins. So let’s get started.</p>\n<h2 class=\"font-headlines\">Should You Be Excited About Plugin Language Packs?</h2>\n<p>As a plugin author, I&#8217;m really excited about the new translation system, and so should you. The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/\">Polyglots team</a> is making it so that you no longer have to include all of your <code>.mo</code> and <code>.po</code> files directly in your plugin. Instead, they will be hosted on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-48731\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-1.png?resize=582%2C575\" alt=\"screenshot-1\" /></a>The ideal scenario is when a user selects their language (either through a new WordPress install or through <code>Settings &gt; General</code>), the language pack for your plugin will be automatically installed and kept updated.</p>\n<p>This new system accomplishes a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Plugin files are smaller. There&#8217;s no need to include translation files with your plugin.</li>\n<li>Plugin authors no longer need to manage translations/translators.</li>\n<li>End users are automatically able to see a plugin in their own language assuming a translation has already been created for their locale.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"font-headlines\">How to Prepare for Plugin Language Packs</h2>\n<p>Before we jump into translating plugins, you first need to prepare your plugin for it to work with the new translation setup.</p>\n<p>In order for you to get your plugin prepared to be moved over to the new system, you need to change your text domain to exactly match your WordPress plugin slug. An important reminder is that even if you have changed your plugin&#8217;s name (as <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/\">Yoast SEO</a> recently did), the slug does not change. For a more in-depth discussion and tutorial, please follow Otto&#8217;s great post on <a href=\"http://ottopress.com/2013/language-packs-101-prepwork/\">language pack prepwork</a>.</p>\n<p>You are still welcome to include translation files in your plugin, even with language packs enabled. Translation files in your plugin take priority, and if those aren&#8217;t present, that&#8217;s where language packs come in.</p>\n<p>When you are preparing your plugin for language packs, it is important to note that you should avoid removing translation files from your plugin. If you do so, and your plugin is selected for language packs, your existing translations will not be automatically moved over to the new system.</p>\n<p>Do your best to keep your translation files with your plugin until the Polyglots team has informed you that your plugin is ready for language packs.</p>\n<h2 class=\"font-headlines\">Wait to Receive the Official Notice</h2>\n<p>The Polyglot team is preparing the plugins in stages to avoid any major hiccups. Assuming your WordPress.org email is up-to-date, you will receive an email when your plugin is ready.</p>\n<p>You may be wondering how long it takes before the team reaches your plugin. There are 40,000+ plugins on WordPress.org, so it is not a quick process. WordPress is preparing plugins in batches according to the amount of active installs each plugin has.</p>\n<p>If your plugin has over 30,000+ active installs, then chances are you are on the new system, although I&#8217;ve seen plugins with 10,000+ active installs also be approved.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there is no way to make the process quicker. Please practice patience and eventually your turn will come.</p>\n<h2 class=\"font-headlines\">You’ve Received the E-Mail That Your Plugin Is Ready</h2>\n<p>So you finally receive the email saying that your plugin is going to be uploaded with language pack support. Awesome! This is what the email that I received looks like. Note that I&#8217;m using one of my approved plugins as an example.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Howdy!<br />\n​<br />\nWe&#8217;re emailing you because you&#8217;re an author for the following plugin on WordPress.org:<br />\n​<br />\n* Easy Updates Manager : https://wordpress.org/plugins/stops-core-theme-and-plugin-updates/<br />\n​<br />\nNext week, we intend to import the plugin listed above into the translate.wordpress.org translation system. Language packs will also be enabled for your plugin, for any locales that are fully translated (at 100%).<br />\n​<br />\nAs part of this process, all of the strings in your plugin will be imported into translate.wordpress.org. Additionally, any language files that you ship with your plugin (&#8216;mo&#8217; files) will be imported and synced with their respective locales within translate.wordpress.org.<br />\n​<br />\nNo strings in your plugin? Plugin translations include the ability to translate the readme and display these translations in the localized WordPress.org plugin directories.</p>\n<p>If you have prepared your plugin already then this notice is of no real importance. If you have not yet prepared your plugin and you have received the notice then you need to prepare your plugin ASAP. If you don’t prepare your plugin then… well… I don’t really know, but it won’t be good. So go and prepare your plugin if you have not yet done so.<br />\n&#8230;</p></blockquote>\n<h2 class=\"font-headlines\">Your Plugin Is Semi-Ready for Language Packs. Now What?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-22.png\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-48741 size-full\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-22.png?resize=291%2C321\" alt=\"screenshot-22\" /></a>A week or so after you receive the notice, your plugin and its translations are moved to <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org\">translate.wordpress.org</a>. You will likely not receive a notice when your plugin is moved.</p>\n<p>To find out if it&#8217;s been uploaded, visit your plugin&#8217;s WordPress.org page where you should see a translations section in the right sidebar. Click the <strong>Translate Plugin Name </strong>button<strong>.</strong> If you are brought to a page that looks like the one below then your plugin is uploaded and is ready to be translated.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-3.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-48734\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-3.png?resize=954%2C611\" alt=\"screenshot-3\" /></a>If you see a page that looks different from this (i.e., a Not Found error), your plugin is not yet ready.</p>\n<p>Assuming you&#8217;ve received the e-mail, your plugin is ready, and you&#8217;ve waited a reasonable amount of time, you should be good to go as far as preparing your plugin.</p>\n<p>If it has been over two weeks and your plugin has not yet been uploaded, you should contact the Polyglot team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/\">on their blog</a>, or in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">#polyglots channel on WordPress Slack</a>. Please exercise extreme patience as the process can take a week or sometimes even two.</p>\n<h2 class=\"font-headlines\">Removing Your Translation Files From Your Plugin</h2>\n<p>Now that your plugin is uploaded to the system, you can safely remove the translation files from your plugin. If you don’t have any <code>.mo</code> and <code>.po</code> files in your plugin, then you can skip this step.</p>\n<p>One thing to note: You may not want to remove your translation files if your plugin does not have any translations on <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/\">translate.wordpress.org</a> or translations are not 100% complete.</p>\n<h2 class=\"font-headlines\">Making Your Plugin Translatable</h2>\n<p>With all of that stuff out-of-the-way, it’s time to focus on translating your plugin. This is where it can get confusing but try to stick with me.</p>\n<p>By default, you cannot submit translations for your plugin in any language. Because of this, you need to ask the Polyglots team to add you as a translator for your plugin. You can do so by heading over to the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/\">Polyglots blog</a> and ask them. To make it easier they came up with a template of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/rosetta/theme-plugin-directories/#sample-post\">what to say</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Hello Polyglots!</p>\n<p>I am the plugin author for [plugin-name and link to plugin directory]. We have a number of great translation editors that we’d like to be able to approve translation for our plugin(s). Please add the following WordPress.org users as translation editors for their respective locales:<br />\no #ar – @username<br />\no #bn – @username, @username<br />\no #da – @username<br />\no #de-ch – @username<br />\netc…</p>\n<p>If you have any questions, just comment here. Thank you!</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ideally, the above will include requests for multiple plugins, but as plugins are being rolled out slowly, it&#8217;s acceptable at the moment to include one request per plugin.</p>\n<p>Make sure that you use WordPress.org usernames and that the user is still active. If you are wondering what languages there are, you can visit <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/\">https://translate.wordpress.org/</a> and scroll through the different languages that WordPress supports.</p>\n<p>Please only ask to be added as a translator for the languages you know. You will not be approved if you are not a native speaker for a language.</p>\n<p>At this point, again, patience is needed. The Polyglot team will receive your request and will work through it. If your post doesn&#8217;t show up right away, it&#8217;s because first-time posters are moderated.</p>\n<p>In a week or two, the translators you requested should be added to your plugin. If there are any issues, a Polyglot member will comment on your request with any difficulties encountered or notify you that they have approved your request.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll know when you are added when you see new badges appear on your WordPress.org profile page. One is a translation editor badge and the other is a translation contributor badge.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-4.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-48735\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-4.png?resize=601%2C322\" alt=\"screenshot-4\" /></a>How Do I Translate?</h2>\n<p>First, visit <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/\">https://translate.wordpress.org/</a>, select your language, then click the plugins tab. Search for your plugin and then click the translate project button. You&#8217;ll be brought to a page that looks like the one below. This page is where you can translate your plugin. In this case, my plugin is already translated in the language that I selected.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-5.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-48736\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-5.png?resize=957%2C587\" alt=\"screenshot-5\" /></a>On this table, there are four separate things to translate. Trunk, the stable release (version), and the <code>readme.txt</code> variations. In order for language packs to work, <em>you need to translate all four versions</em>.</p>\n<p>To translate, click on one of the sub-projects. This takes you to the translation page. Here, you can see all of the different strings that need to be translated in your plugin. You can edit a string by clicking the details button, translating it in the text editor, and then clicking the <strong>add translations</strong> button.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-6.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-48737\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-6.png?resize=947%2C561\" alt=\"screenshot-6\" /></a>Even if you&#8217;re not added as an editor for a language, you can still translate a plugin. The only difference is instead of adding the translations directly, you can only request that it be changed. Someone from the Polyglots team will need review and approve your translation suggestions.</p>\n<h2 class=\"font-headlines\">Once Your Translations Are Ready</h2>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve finished translating a language completely, it will be available for people to use.

However, he also cites a third way to test WordPress via <a href=\"http://wcpdx.trywpbeta.com/\">TryWPBeta.com</a>.</p>\n<p> \n<div> <strong> <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/DrewAPicture/trying-out-tomorrows-wordpress-today\" title=\"Trying Out Tomorrow’s WordPress Today\" target=\"_blank\">Trying Out Tomorrow’s WordPress Today</a> </strong> from <strong><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/DrewAPicture\" target=\"_blank\">DrewAPicture</a></strong> </div>\n<p>TryWPBeta is a locked down, vanilla install of WordPress trunk using Multisite. To login to the site, use the following credentials.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Username</strong>: wcpdx</li>\n<li><strong>Password</strong>: wcpdx15</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I asked Jaynes what inspired him to create the site, &#8220;The inspiration for TryWPBeta is to actually have a place for core contributors to test patches on mobile devices, because setting up a tunnel to a local development setup is difficult and a high barrier for a lot of people.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The idea is to make it possible to spin up a site using trunk (Bleeding edge version of WordPress), apply a specific patch and then freeze it in time so that we can point people there to test on mobile devices,&#8221; Jaynes told the Tavern.</p>\n<p>While you can&#8217;t install themes and plugins yet, the site gives users an opportunity to test new features without worrying about breaking the site. Thanks to TryWPBeta, I was able to test the new <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/34903\">Post oEmbed feature</a> in 4.4.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/TestingPostoEmbeds.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-48714\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/TestingPostoEmbeds.png?resize=1025%2C458\" alt=\"Testing oEmbeds of Posts\" /></a>Testing oEmbeds of Posts\n<p>Jaynes started the project at 10up&#8217;s company summit. So far, Scott Reilly, John Blackbourn, Zach Brown, Morgan Estes, and Chris Weigman have contributed to the project. The site is hosted on a DigitalOcean droplet and updates hourly. He stresses that the site is a work in progress and not quite ready for prime time, &#8220;There’s a couple features I’d like to add to make it more robust first,&#8221; Jaynes said.</p>\n<p>Unlike <a href=\"https://demo.joomla.org/\">Joomla</a>, WordPress doesn&#8217;t have a dedicated demo site for users to test drive the software. While I like the idea behind TryWPBeta, there are a few things I&#8217;d like to see added to make it more useful. For instance, a list of items to test that users can check off. Also, an easy way to provide feedback on the listed items that is sent to a place where core developers will read it.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, I&#8217;d like to see the WordPress Beta Testing plugin extended to have the features I mentioned above. Between the communication challenges and setting up the environment, the beta testing process in WordPress is not as easy and streamlined as it could be. What ideas do you have that would help increase the testing audience and make the process easier?</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 27 Oct 2015 00:37:45 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"WPTavern: VersionPress Raises $400K in Seed Funding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=48709\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"http://wptavern.com/versionpress-raises-400k-in-seed-funding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2780:\"<p><a href=\"http://versionpress.net/\">VersionPress</a>, a version control plugin for WordPress, has <a href=\"http://blog.versionpress.net/2015/10/seed-funding/\">raised $400K in seed funding</a> from five investors, led by <a href=\"http://www.credoventures.com/\">Credo Ventures</a> based in Prague. In July of 2014, VersionPress conducted a <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/versionpress-misses-crowdfunding-goal-by-14-5k\">crowdfunding campaign</a> to raise $30K. However, the team raised only <strong>45% of the $30,000</strong> funding goal.</p>\n<p>The team pressed on and released the first version back in January. Since then, the team has relied on funding from the <a href=\"http://versionpress.net/\">Early Access Program</a>. Borek Bernard, the lead developer of VersionPress, says the influx of cash will help fuel rapid development:</p>\n<blockquote><p>First and foremost, it means that we will be able to develop VersionPress at a more rapid pace. What we currently have in the <a href=\"http://blog.versionpress.net/2015/10/versionpress-2-0-released/\">recently released v2.0</a> is a great start but the vision and the technical challenge are just so large that this new fuel will is more than welcome. We have many cool features planned and this will allow us to deliver them in a timely manner.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The funding comes on the heels of <a href=\"http://blog.versionpress.net/2015/10/versionpress-2-0-released/\">VersionPress 2.0</a> which includes, database synchronization functionality and an updated user interface that is completely JavaScript based, along with a number of other features. In addition to funding, Bernard says talking to investors gives him a fresh perspective on the project:</p>\n<blockquote><p>One big benefit of talking to investors is that it provides a fresh perspective on the problems one is trying to solve, how to solve them, for whom, etc. Speaking to them made us realize a couple of important things which will greatly benefit our users down the road.</p></blockquote>\n<p>VersionPress joins a growing list of WordPress products and services that have raised venture capital. In 2014, <a title=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/coschedule-by-todaymade/\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/coschedule-by-todaymade/\">CoSchedule</a>, the editorial workflow and activity scheduling plugin, <a title=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/coschedule-series-a-funding/\" href=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/coschedule-series-a-funding/\">secured $500K</a> in a Series A round of funding.

His work is something I’ve always looked up to. His work on plugins has inspired me to pursue the plugin/product market,&#8221; Vimal said.</p>\n<p>Licenses start at $10 for single sites, $20 for two to five sites, and $35 for an unlimited number of sites. Vimal says that he is working on a new version with changes in design, functionality, and more. The plugin will also receive its own dedicated site with a change in branding.</p>\n<p>It will be interesting to see what changes Vimal has in store for the plugin.

With <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/35294\">the change</a>, plugin authors will be able to check for theme support and use a few new filters to manipulate the title. The new filters are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>\'pre_get_document_title\'</code> short-circuits <code>wp_get_document_title()</code> if it returns anything other than an empty value.</li>\n<li><code>\'document_title_separator\'</code> filters the separator between title parts.</li>\n<li><code>\'document_title_parts\'</code> filters the parts that make up the document title, passed in an associative array.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Theme authors should no longer use <code>wp_title()</code> to generate document titles. If theme authors add <code>add_theme_support( ‘title-tag’ );</code> to the <code>after_setup_theme</code> callback, the title will be handled natively via an internal WordPress core function. If you use a theme that utilizes wp_title and have <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/WP_DEBUG\">wp_debug enabled</a> in WordPress 4.4, you&#8217;ll see a deprecation notice.</p>\n<p>In general, users who upgrade to WordPress 4.4 won&#8217;t notice a difference. However, with nearly a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/version-4-4-project-schedule/\">month to go</a> before WordPress 4.4 is released, theme developers are highly encouraged to check and update their themes accordingly.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 22 Oct 2015 07:52:18 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: Anyssa Ferreira Awarded the Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=48662\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"http://wptavern.com/anyssa-ferreira-awarded-the-kim-parsell-memorial-scholarship\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2542:\"<p>Back in August, the WordPress Foundation <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-foundation-begins-accepting-applications-for-the-kim-parsell-memorial-scholarship\">began accepting applications</a> for the <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-foundation-creates-a-traveling-scholarship-in-memory-of-kim-parsell\">Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship</a>.

In the announcement, we recommended that other WordPress users across the globe urgently consider blocking the technology on their own web servers as well.</p>\n<h2>XML-RPC in WordPress Has a Troubled Past</h2>\n<p>Days after the announcement<em>,</em> Daniel Cid, founder and CTO of Sucuri, and Mark Maunder, CEO of WordFence, <a href=\"https://blog.sucuri.net/2015/10/brute-force-amplification-attacks-against-wordpress-xmlrpc.html\" target=\"_blank\">confirmed</a> the <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2015/10/wordpress-xml-rpc-brute-force-attacks-amplification-multiple-logins/\" target=\"_blank\">reports</a> that a new type of Brute Force login attack was being carried out on a massive scale against WordPress sites around the world using XML-RPC. Apparently, hackers have wised up to the fact that <code>wp-login.php</code> is often well protected.</p>\n<p>Perhaps more shocking than this latest wave of attacks is that <em>they are nothing new,</em> as Sucuri previously <a href=\"https://blog.sucuri.net/2014/07/new-brute-force-attacks-exploiting-xmlrpc-in-wordpress.html\">reported a similar wave of attacks</a> in July 2014. Let&#8217;s also not forget the wide-scale use of XML-RPC to perform <a href=\"http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/D/DDoS_attack.html\">DDoS attacks</a> on WordPress websites <a href=\"https://www.incapsula.com/blog/wordpress-security-alert-pingback-ddos.html\">reported by Incapsula</a> in 2013. Combine these reports with <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=site%3Awordpress.org%2Fsupport%2F+xml-rpc+attack\">hundreds of posts</a> on the wordpress.org support forums and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=site%3Astackoverflow.com+xml-rpc+attack\">Stack Overflow</a> and a picture is painted of years of unhindered attacks against millions of WordPress sites due to this single PHP file, yikes!</p>\n<blockquote><p>It is common sense to take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something. ― Franklin D. Roosevelt</p></blockquote>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t expect to be the one to advocate that XML-RPC be removed from WordPress but that&#8217;s exactly what I&#8217;m doing: <strong>It&#8217;s time for WordPress XML-RPC to hit the road, for good.</strong></p>\n<h2>XML-RPC Was a Conscious Mistake</h2>\n<p>I understand that thousands of volunteer hours have been invested into XML-RPC support for the WordPress platform, as is the nature of open-source communities. I sincerely respect and thank said programmers and volunteers for creating a very cool way to remotely connect to a website built on WordPress. But sometimes, we need to be honest with ourselves and admit when something isn&#8217;t working; <em>This one of those times.</em></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re wondering why I&#8217;m framing the XML-RPC mess as a conscious mistake, <strong>that&#8217;s because it was</strong>. Three years ago, Andrew Nacin, a WordPress core developer, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21509\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> in a trac ticket that, <em>&#8220;Security is no greater a concern than the rest of core. There is no longer a compelling reason to disable [XML-RPC] by default. It’s time we should remove the option entirely.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Three years later, millions of WordPress sites have been hacked, crashed, or attacked, due to XML-RPC. It’s undeniable that removing the option to disable it (and/or enabling it by default) was wrong.</p>\n<h2>Out of Touch With the Average User</h2>\n<p>When broken down, it&#8217;s a classic case of extremely talented and intelligent software developers being out of touch with the millions of <strong>average Joes</strong> that use WordPress and have no idea what XML-RPC is. When developers inevitably argue that there are several free security plugins available that can help combat XML-RPC attacks, they completely miss the point: <u>the majority of webmasters being attacked are the same ones who don&#8217;t even know what a security plugin is or how to use it</u>.</p>\n<p>Ironically, the one good <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/bruteprotect/\" target=\"_blank\">standalone plugin</a> that fought Brute Force login attempts was <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-parka-llc-the-creators-of-bruteprotect\" target=\"_blank\">foolishly</a> <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/jetpack-protect-blocks-brute-force-amplification-attacks\" target=\"_blank\">combined</a> into the controversial Jetpack plugin, which most serious webmasters would never consider installing.</p>\n<p>The premise, of course, for XML-RPC support in WordPress is a noble idea that sounds versatile: it allows, as previously mentioned, remote connections (logins, usually) to any given domain that is running a WordPress installation. In reality, however, this XML-RPC functionality is primarily used for three common reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pingbacks/trackbacks (great for Viagra spam, <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wptavern-was-trackbacked-to-death\" target=\"_blank\">DDoS attacks</a>, and not much else)</li>\n<li>Jetpack (an all-in-one solution to <a href=\"http://blog.arunas.co/project-measure-jetpack/\" target=\"_blank\">slowing down</a> and/or bloating your WordPress site with third-party scripts)</li>\n<li>WP mobile apps (I&#8217;m not sure who blogs from their smart phone, but the <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yo./id834335592\" target=\"_blank\">YO app</a> is literally rated higher than <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/wordpress/id335703880\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress</a> on the iTunes store, and the user reviews of the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wordpress.android\" target=\"_blank\">Android</a> version repeatedly point to XML-RPC login issues)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Do recall that the WordPress backend is now responsive, which means you can login to your blog from practically any mobile device; this wasn’t the case when the native WordPress mobile apps were first launched. And arguably, the vast majority of WordPress sites have absolutely no use for pingbacks, trackbacks, or XML-RPC in general.</p>\n<h2>XML-RPC Needs to Be Disabled or Removed From WordPress</h2>\n<p><u>The logical conclusion should be immediately clear:</u> XML-RPC needs to die a quick death in the WordPress community, or at least be shifted into an optional (non-default) plugin or otherwise, in order to bring an immediate and measurable improvement to the security and stability of not only WordPress sites, but the internet overall.</p>\n<p>Perhaps Jeff Chandler <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/how-to-prevent-wordpress-from-participating-in-pingback-denial-of-service-attacks\" target=\"_blank\">said it best</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>WP Tavern is no stranger to denial of service attacks due to pingbacks and trackbacks. In 2010, I explained how WP Tavern was trackbacked to death. Shortly after the website came back online, I disabled both as I feared they might end up taking the site down again. A few years have gone by and I’ve re-enabled pingbacks and trackbacks with no ill effects. However, I wonder if it’s time to kill them once and for all, not just on WP Tavern but in WordPress in general.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sometimes, we as developers and others with a technical mindset get caught up in solving the challenge of the day, when what is really needed is to step back and take a more philosophical look at the bigger picture. Is this thing worth our time, or is it causing more problems than solutions? When it comes to XML-RPC in WordPress, the conclusion is obvious.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 21 Oct 2015 21:33:32 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"Post Status: Playing with type\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=14750\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"https://poststatus.com/playing-with-type/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8443:\"<p>I am far from a typography expert, but I do love playing with type. I delight in a great reading experience, and I strongly believe typography is the key to creating a great reading experience.</p>\n<p>In my own journeys searching for and choosing typefaces for my projects, I&#8217;ve discovered some great tools, and also some pitfalls of using different delivery services.</p>\n<p>I have <a href=\"http://typography.com\">Typography.com</a> and <a href=\"http://typekit.com\">Typekit</a> accounts, and of course using <a href=\"http://google.com/fonts\">Google Fonts</a> is very simple. Many folks also use <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/\">Myfonts</a>, generate their own on <a href=\"http://www.fontsquirrel.com/\">Fontsquirrel</a>, self-host direct from foundries, or use a variety of other methods.</p>\n<p>When you use a font delivery service, where the font is hosted elsewhere, and you simply connect (like Typekit or Typography.com), one of the things you deal with is the authentication of your site with the service that can often cause sad delays in pageload times. Zach Tollman did a great post discussing how <a href=\"https://www.tollmanz.com/typography-coms-cssom-blocking-font-loader/\">Typography.com in particular is not good at handling this authentication</a>, from a performance perspective.</p>\n<p>Given that I host Post Status fonts on Typography.com &#8212; I use Gotham Round, Gotham Condensed, and Sentinel here, and none of them are available anywhere else &#8212; the hit on performance perturbs me. However, I love these fonts and hate to replace them. However, I&#8217;ve lately been doing some research so I can at least test font stacks from Typekit and Google to see how big of an impact it could have.</p>\n<h3>Finding Typefaces</h3>\n<p>Finding quality typefaces is a challenge. There are <em>so many</em> out there, and the differences in quality can be vast. Part of what I love about Typography.com is that the quality of the display and cross-browser rendering is outstanding. Typekit serves typefaces from a variety of foundries, but they too have built great tools over the years to try and ensure quality rendering. Google is more of a mixed bag, though open source typefaces are getting more attention to detail in recent years than ever before.</p>\n<p>By far, my favorite tool for browsing and finding typefaces is <a href=\"https://www.typewolf.com\">Typewolf</a>. Typewolf has PDF guides (free with your email), trending typefaces, sites of the day, and high quality recommendations on when and where to use a particular typeface. A sample resource that&#8217;s outstanding is their list of the <a href=\"https://www.typewolf.com/open-source-web-fonts\">top 30 open source Google fonts</a>. They have many others like that. It&#8217;s definitely a must-visit site when you are considering changing up your site typography.</p>\n<p>You can also browse delivery services directly. Typekit&#8217;s <a href=\"https://typekit.com/lists\">lists</a> are pretty good for narrowing typefaces by their intended purpose. <a href=\"http://justmytype.co/\">Justmytype</a> is another great resource that shows recommended pairings for fonts from Typekit and Typography.com. And of course Google has filters in their directory to help narrow it down, but it&#8217;s still a bit of the wild west, so I usually rely on Googling good pairings for Google.</p>\n<h3>Tinkering with typefaces with real content</h3>\n<p>Once you find some Typefaces you like, then it&#8217;s fun to put them into practice. <a href=\"http://typecast.com/\">Typecast</a> is excellent. You can find fonts from many foundries with a free account, and do all sorts of manipulations to see the typefaces in action, using a variety of font combinations, before you move to your actual site.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-14749\" src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/typecast-view-752x462.png\" alt=\"typecast-view\" width=\"752\" height=\"462\" /></p>\n<p>Beware, it&#8217;s easy to spend hours in this tool. I love that you can edit the CSS directly, and there are also tools within Typecast to insert particular types of content, so you can have a working prototype pretty quickly.</p>\n<h3>Performance implications</h3>\n<p>Loading fonts is a huge performance issue sometimes. Too many fonts, content blocking loading, time-outs from third party delivery services, and other gotchas can severely impact a site&#8217;s load times.</p>\n<p>Anytime you are looking at new typefaces to use, consider where you can serve them from, whether you can self host them, how the delivery authenticates, and potentially more &#8212; before you get your heart set.</p>\n<p>Some good rules of thumb are this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google is by far the fastest, but you just don&#8217;t have access to some of the greatest font foundries this way, because all Google fonts are free.</li>\n<li>Self hosting is probably similar to or faster than serving them from Google. Most Google fonts are locally cached on lots of folks computers. Self hosting may be better for a more rare font, but for common fonts, Google may actually be faster.</li>\n<li>System fonts are always the fastest, but you might not be able to deliver your preferred typeface if the system the reader is using doesn&#8217;t support the typeface. If using system typefaces, creating thorough font stacks is a necessity. Sometimes, especially for sans-serifs, I&#8217;m tempted to just declare sans-serif, so that the system serves its favorite font &#8212; as Android, Mac, iOS, Windows, et al each have their own defaults. For serifs, I&#8217;d say just use Georgia if using system fonts only <img src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></li>\n<li>Typekit and Myfonts and other delivery services are usually similar in quality, but it&#8217;s one of the slowest options for delivery. Be sure to only use the weights and versions you need, and considering limiting character sets if you can get away with it.</li>\n<li>Have a performance budget for your type. Sometimes you have to make hard choices. Does your body font really need to be a non-system font? What if you just used a single display font to add the character you seek? Can you get away without italics for a certain typeface you&#8217;re using? What about bold? If you use the regular/bold/italic/bold-italic for every typeface, that adds up quickly. Use the bare minimum and add whenever you need to only.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Don&#8217;t get too fancy, and consider your tone</h3>\n<p>My biggest mistakes over the years playing with type have been getting too fancy, especially with body copy. Simple is good with type. Especially when choosing body copy, be sure to learn about the typeface you like &#8212; and don&#8217;t just trust your own eye early on &#8212; to see if it&#8217;s an appropriate workhorse typeface.</p>\n<p>With display type, you have more leeway, but consider the mood that the typeface sets. Slabs, serifs, gothic, humanist, and other styles of type each tend to have their own tone that they set. For instance, when you read the New York Times, Georgia is a serious workhorse font, and the custom display font also sets a sober tone. Compared to Vox, for example, which uses a more casual sans-serif body copy and quite decorative display typeface. In both scenarios, readability is very good, but they set a different tone.</p>\n<h3>Learning typography takes time</h3>\n<p>Learning and understanding good typography practices takes time. Many factors are at play to make a typeface look great, and even the greatest typefaces can get screwed up when not used well.</p>\n<p>Learning best practices for things like line length, line height, pairing, and much much more can probably get you farther than what typeface you choose. And different typefaces obviously do better in different settings. The key is to take it slow, learn what you like when you are reading other websites, and see what they are doing that you are not. Also, ask your friends about your choices and get feedback; sometimes just a minor change can make a big difference, and suddenly your design clicks.</p>\n<p>We can easily be blind to our own typography mistakes. If you can limit mistakes and learn the essentials of choosing typefaces and using them well, your websites will look much, much better and your readers will be thankful, even if they never say it.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 16 Oct 2015 17:23:32 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Brian Krogsgard\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"Post Status: Work life balance — Draft podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=14740\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"https://poststatus.com/work-life-balance-draft-podcast/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1393:\"<p>Welcome to the Post Status Draft podcast, which you can find <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\">on iTunes</a> and <a href=\"http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss\">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.
